How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure functionality in any project it needs to be thoroughly tested. I try to reach 100% coverage with my unit tests and to have another review the code and functionality of my program to make sure I did not miss anything.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are the reason the program is being written so it is important that they are fully understood before creating the program. Taking with the creator of the requirements and meeting them when necessary helps me keep the program in line with their goals.


How do I approach designing software?
Software design should always be requiremently focused. Code should be written to be as efficient as possible in reaching the goals of the requirements while having the least amount or errors or bugs possible.
